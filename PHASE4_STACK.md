# Phase 4: Stack Implementation - Progress Report

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Stack Data Structure

#### Core Stack Class (`src/core/stack.py`)
- ✅ **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) ordering** - Proper Magic: The Gathering stack semantics
- ✅ **StackObject model** - Represents spells and abilities on the stack
- ✅ **StackObjectType enum** - Distinguishes between spells and abilities
- ✅ **State tracking** - Size, empty check, peek without popping

#### Stack Operations
- ✅ `push()` - Add object to stack
- ✅ `pop()` - Remove and return top object
- ✅ `peek()` - View top object without removing
- ✅ `get_all()` - Get all objects (bottom to top)
- ✅ `to_dict()` - Serialize for LLM/game state
- ✅ `clear()` - Reset stack

### 2. Priority Passing System

#### Priority Management
- ✅ **Priority order** - Rotates starting with active player, going clockwise
- ✅ `set_priority_order()` - Initialize priority based on active player
- ✅ `get_priority_player()` - Get current player with priority
- ✅ `pass_priority()` - Pass to next player, returns True when all pass
- ✅ **Pass tracking** - Counts consecutive passes to determine resolution

#### Priority Rules
- ✅ Priority resets to active player after spell/ability added to stack
- ✅ Priority resets after resolving a stack object
- ✅ When all players pass with stack empty → phase advances
- ✅ When all players pass with objects on stack → top object resolves

### 3. Stack-Based Spell Resolution

#### Modified Rules Engine
- ✅ **`cast_spell()` updated** - Spells go to stack instead of resolving immediately
- ✅ **`resolve_top_of_stack()`** - Resolves top spell from stack
- ✅ **Pending card tracking** - Stores card instances until resolution
- ✅ **Game state sync** - Stack state reflected in `game_state.stack`

#### Resolution Flow
```
1. Player casts spell → Spell goes on stack
2. Priority passes around table
3. Players can respond with instants (future)
4. All pass → Top spell resolves
5. Repeat until stack empty
```

#### Spell Resolution
- ✅ Creatures → Battlefield (with summoning sickness)
- ✅ Other spells → Graveyard after effect
- ✅ Proper LIFO resolution order
- ✅ Priority reset after each resolution

### 4. Integration with Game State

#### RulesEngine Updates
- ✅ Stack instance created in `__init__`
- ✅ `_pending_cards` dictionary for tracking cards on stack
- ✅ Priority order initialized in `start_game()`
- ✅ `pass_priority()` method for priority passing

#### GameState Updates
- ✅ `model_config` allows arbitrary types (for Stack)
- ✅ `stack` field serializes stack state for tools/LLM
- ✅ Stack state accessible via `game_state.stack`

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Suite (`tests/test_stack.py`)
Created comprehensive test suite with **9 new tests**:

1. ✅ `test_stack_basic_operations` - Push, pop, peek, size
2. ✅ `test_stack_priority_order` - Priority rotation
3. ✅ `test_stack_priority_with_active_player` - Priority starts correctly
4. ✅ `test_cast_spell_puts_on_stack` - Spells don't resolve immediately
5. ✅ `test_resolve_stack_creature` - Creature resolution to battlefield
6. ✅ `test_stack_lifo_resolution` - Last-in-first-out order
7. ✅ `test_pass_priority_with_empty_stack` - Empty stack behavior
8. ✅ `test_priority_resets_after_stack_addition` - Pass counter resets
9. ✅ `test_stack_to_dict` - Serialization works

### Test Results
```
========== 25 passed in 0.24s ==========
- 16 existing tests (still passing)
- 9 new stack tests
```

## 📊 Architecture

### Before (Phase 3)
```
cast_spell() → Immediately resolve → Battlefield/Graveyard
```

### After (Phase 4)
```
cast_spell() → Stack → Priority passes → Resolve top → Battlefield/Graveyard
                  ↑
                  └─ Players can respond (future)
```

### Stack Example
```
Turn 3, Main Phase:
1. Player 1 casts "Llanowar Elves" → Stack: [Llanowar Elves]
2. Priority to Player 2 (could respond with instant)
3. Player 2 passes
4. Player 3 passes  
5. Player 4 passes
6. All passed → Resolve Llanowar Elves → Battlefield
7. Stack now empty
```

## 🎯 What's Working

### Core Stack Mechanics
- ✅ LIFO resolution order (last spell cast resolves first)
- ✅ Priority passing system with proper rotation
- ✅ Spells go to stack before resolving
- ✅ Proper integration with existing rules engine
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Clean separation: Stack class handles stack logic
- ✅ RulesEngine orchestrates game flow
- ✅ GameState stores serialized stack for LLM access
- ✅ Backward compatible - existing code works unchanged

## 🚧 Known Limitations

### Not Yet Implemented
- ❌ **Instant-speed responses** - Players can't cast instants in response yet
- ❌ **Stack awareness in LLM** - Agent doesn't understand stack yet
- ❌ **Instant spells in database** - No counterspells, combat tricks, etc.
- ❌ **Activated abilities** - Only spells on stack, not abilities
- ❌ **Triggered abilities** - No automatic triggers going on stack
- ❌ **Stack interaction tools** - LLM can't query or respond to stack

### Current Simplifications
- ⚠️ No instant-speed casting (everything is sorcery-speed)
- ⚠️ No ability to respond to opponent's spells
- ⚠️ Priority auto-passes (LLM doesn't make priority decisions yet)
- ⚠️ No state-based actions checked during priority passes
- ⚠️ No "split second" or uncounterable mechanics

## 📈 Next Steps (Complete Phase 4)

### Immediate Priority
1. **Add Instant Spells to Card Database**
   - Counterspell, Cancel, Negate
   - Combat tricks (Giant Growth, etc.)
   - Instant removal (Lightning Bolt, Path to Exile)

2. **LLM Stack Awareness**
   - New tool: `get_stack_state()` - View current stack
   - New tool: `can_respond()` - Check if can cast instant
   - Update prompts to explain stack concepts
   - Add priority decision points

3. **Instant-Speed Interaction**
   - Allow casting instants with priority
   - "Hold priority" vs "pass priority" decisions
   - Response windows in combat
   - Response windows to opponent spells

4. **Priority Management in Game Loop**
   - Don't auto-advance when stack has objects
   - Give each player opportunity to respond
   - Check for instant-speed actions before resolution

### Testing Needs
- Test instant spell casting
- Test responding to opponent spells
- Test priority holds
- Test complex stack scenarios (3+ spells)
- Test combat tricks with stack

## 🎉 Summary

**Phase 4 (Stack Implementation) - Core Complete!**

Successfully implemented:
- ✅ **Proper Magic stack** with LIFO ordering
- ✅ **Priority system** with clockwise passing
- ✅ **Stack-based resolution** for all spells
- ✅ **9 comprehensive tests** validating behavior
- ✅ **25 total tests passing** (100% success rate)

**Key Achievement**: The foundation for instant-speed interaction is now in place. Spells properly go on the stack and resolve in correct order. Priority system works correctly.

**Remaining Work**: Make the LLM agent aware of the stack and able to cast instants/respond to opponent spells. This requires tool updates and prompt engineering, but the hard part (stack mechanics) is done.

**Next Milestone**: Full instant-speed interaction with LLM making priority decisions and responding to opponent plays.

## Code Examples

### Casting a Spell (Now Uses Stack)
```python
# Old way (Phase 3): Immediate resolution
rules_engine.cast_spell(player, card)
# Card is now on battlefield

# New way (Phase 4): Goes to stack
rules_engine.cast_spell(player, card)
# Card is on stack, not resolved yet
print(rules_engine.stack.size())  # 1

# Resolve when all pass
rules_engine.resolve_top_of_stack()
# Now card is on battlefield
```

### Priority Passing
```python
# Initialize priority order
player_ids = ["p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"]
rules_engine.stack.set_priority_order(player_ids, "p1")

# Pass priority around table
rules_engine.stack.pass_priority()  # p1 → p2
rules_engine.stack.pass_priority()  # p2 → p3
rules_engine.stack.pass_priority()  # p3 → p4
all_passed = rules_engine.stack.pass_priority()  # p4 → p1
# all_passed == True (everyone passed once)
```

### Stack State for LLM
```python
# Get stack state
stack_dict = rules_engine.stack.to_dict()
# {
#   "objects": [{"name": "Llanowar Elves", "type": "spell", ...}],
#   "size": 1,
#   "priority_player": "p2"
# }

# Also available in game_state
print(game_state.stack)  # List of stack objects
```
