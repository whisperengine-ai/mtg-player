# MTG Commander AI - Project Summary

## 🎯 Vision
Build an AI agent that can play Magic: The Gathering Commander using modern agentic architecture (LLM + tools + Chain-of-Thought reasoning) instead of traditional fine-tuning.

## 📦 What's Included

This proof-of-concept includes:

### ✅ Core Implementation
- **Game State Management** - Complete representation of MTG game state
- **Rules Engine** - Validates and executes game actions
- **Stack System** - Instant-speed spells, responses, priority passing
- **Player & Card Models** - Full data structures for cards and players
- **Turn Structure** - Beginning → Main → Combat → Main → End phases
- **Multiplayer Support** - 2-4 player Commander format

### ✅ Agentic AI System
- **Tool Layer** - 6 core tools for LLM interaction:
  - `get_game_state()` - View current game
  - `get_legal_actions()` - See available moves
  - `execute_action()` - Perform validated actions
  - `analyze_threats()` - Evaluate board state
  - `get_stack_state()` - View the spell stack
  - `can_respond()` - Check for instant-speed responses
- **LLM Agent** - Decision-making engine with CoT reasoning
- **Prompt Templates** - Structured prompts for strategic thinking
- **OpenRouter Integration** - Access to multiple LLM providers

### ✅ Supporting Infrastructure
- **Card Database** - 151 Commander staple cards
- **Archetype Deck Builders** - Ramp, Control, Midrange decks
- **Logging System** - Complete game and LLM interaction logs
- **Test Suite** - 38 passing tests for rules and game logic
- **CLI Interface** - Play games with verbose output

### ✅ Documentation
- **README.md** - Project overview
- **ROADMAP.md** - 14-week development plan
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed setup and extension guide
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design and data flow diagrams
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Get running in 5 minutes

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Three-Layer Design
```
LLM Agent (Strategy) → Tools (Bridge) → Rules Engine (Validation)
```

**Key Innovation**: LLM never directly manipulates game state. All actions are validated, preventing hallucinated illegal moves.

### Why This Approach?
- ✅ No training data needed
- ✅ All moves guaranteed legal
- ✅ Explainable decisions
- ✅ Easy to debug and iterate
- ✅ No GPU training required

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase**: 4 (Stack and Instant-Speed) - Complete ✅

### Working
- ✅ Complete game loop with phase advancement
- ✅ Turn structure (all phases and steps)
- ✅ Land drops and mana management
- ✅ Spell casting (sorceries, instants, creatures)
- ✅ Combat (attackers/blockers/damage)
- ✅ Stack system with priority passing
- ✅ Instant-speed responses
- ✅ Win condition detection
- ✅ LLM-powered AI decision making
- ✅ Complete logging (game events + LLM interactions)
- ✅ Multiplayer (2-4 players)
- ✅ 38 tests passing

### Next Steps (Phase 5+)
- Triggered abilities (enters-the-battlefield, dies, etc.)
- More complex card abilities
- Better threat assessment
- Mana curve optimization
- Meta-game learning

## 🎮 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenRouter or OpenAI key

# Run the game
python run.py --verbose           # 4-player game with console output
python run.py --players=2         # 2-player game, logs only
```

### Logging

**Console output** (with `--verbose`):
- Turn-by-turn game progress
- Player life and board state
- Game results

**Log files** (in `logs/` directory):
- `game_*.log` - Turn progression, actions, phase changes
- `llm_*.log` - Complete LLM prompts, responses, reasoning, tool calls, token usage

All LLM interactions are logged to files, keeping console output clean and readable.

## 📈 Development Roadmap

- LLM tool calling
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning
### Phase 3: Commander Features (Weeks 7-10)
- 4-player support
### Phase 4: Advanced AI (Weeks 11-14)

### Phase 5: Polish (Week 15+)
- Deck building assistant
- Learning from games
- Web interface
- 2,000+ cards

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Agentic AI
Instead of fine-tuning a model to "know" MTG, we give a base LLM tools to interact with the game:
- **Gather info** via tools
- **Reason** about strategy
- **Take actions** through validated interface

### Chain-of-Thought
LLM thinks step-by-step:
1. **Analyze**: What's happening?
2. **Plan**: What's my goal?
3. **Options**: What can I do?
4. **Evaluate**: What's best?
5. **Execute**: Make the move

### Tool-Based Validation
```python
# LLM wants to do something
llm: "I want to cast Lightning Bolt"

# Tool validates and executes
rules_engine: "✅ Legal, executed"
# or
rules_engine: "❌ Not enough mana"
```

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

This project teaches:
- **Agentic AI Architecture** - Tool use vs fine-tuning
- **LLM Prompt Engineering** - CoT, structured reasoning
- **Game AI Design** - State representation, planning
- **Software Architecture** - Separation of concerns, validation
- **Testing Strategies** - Unit tests, integration tests

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### For MTG
- Could assist players with decisions
- Teaches strategy through explanation
- Enables AI playtesting of decks

### For You
- Practice software engineering
