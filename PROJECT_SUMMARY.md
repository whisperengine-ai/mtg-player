# MTG Commander AI - Project Summary

## 🎯 Vision
Build an AI agent that can play Magic: The Gathering Commander using modern agentic architecture (LLM + tools + Chain-of-Thought reasoning) instead of traditional fine-tuning.

## 📦 What's Included

This proof-of-concept includes:

### ✅ Core Implementation
- **Game State Management** - Complete representation of MTG game state
- **Rules Engine** - Validates and executes game actions
- **Player & Card Models** - Full data structures for cards and players
- **Turn Structure** - Beginning → Main → Combat → Main → End phases

### ✅ Agentic AI System
- **Tool Layer** - 4 core tools for LLM interaction:
  - `get_game_state()` - View current game
  - `get_legal_actions()` - See available moves
  - `execute_action()` - Perform validated actions
  - `analyze_threats()` - Evaluate board state
- **LLM Agent** - Decision-making engine with CoT reasoning
- **Prompt Templates** - Structured prompts for strategic thinking

### ✅ Supporting Infrastructure
- **Card Database** - ~50 basic cards (lands, creatures, spells)
- **Deck Builder** - Creates 100-card Commander decks
- **Test Suite** - Unit tests for rules and game logic
- **CLI Interface** - Play games with verbose output

### ✅ Documentation
- **README.md** - Project overview
- **ROADMAP.md** - 14-week development plan
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed setup and extension guide
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design and data flow diagrams
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Get running in 5 minutes

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Three-Layer Design
```
LLM Agent (Strategy) → Tools (Bridge) → Rules Engine (Validation)
```

**Key Innovation**: LLM never directly manipulates game state. All actions are validated, preventing hallucinated illegal moves.

### Why This Approach?
- ✅ No training data needed
- ✅ All moves guaranteed legal
- ✅ Explainable decisions
- ✅ Easy to debug and iterate
- ✅ No GPU training required

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase**: 1 (Foundation) - 80% complete

### Working
- ✅ Basic game loop
- ✅ Turn structure
- ✅ Land drops
- ✅ Spell casting
- ✅ Combat (attackers/blockers/damage)
- ✅ Win condition detection
- ✅ Simple rule-based AI


### Next Steps (Phase 2)

## 🎮 How to Use
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Add LLM (Future)
```bash
# Run with LLM
python src/main.py --llm
```

## 📈 Development Roadmap

- LLM tool calling
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning
### Phase 3: Commander Features (Weeks 7-10)
- 4-player support
### Phase 4: Advanced AI (Weeks 11-14)

### Phase 5: Polish (Week 15+)
- Deck building assistant
- Learning from games
- Web interface
- 2,000+ cards

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Agentic AI
Instead of fine-tuning a model to "know" MTG, we give a base LLM tools to interact with the game:
- **Gather info** via tools
- **Reason** about strategy
- **Take actions** through validated interface

### Chain-of-Thought
LLM thinks step-by-step:
1. **Analyze**: What's happening?
2. **Plan**: What's my goal?
3. **Options**: What can I do?
4. **Evaluate**: What's best?
5. **Execute**: Make the move

### Tool-Based Validation
```python
# LLM wants to do something
llm: "I want to cast Lightning Bolt"

# Tool validates and executes
rules_engine: "✅ Legal, executed"
# or
rules_engine: "❌ Not enough mana"
```

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

This project teaches:
- **Agentic AI Architecture** - Tool use vs fine-tuning
- **LLM Prompt Engineering** - CoT, structured reasoning
- **Game AI Design** - State representation, planning
- **Software Architecture** - Separation of concerns, validation
- **Testing Strategies** - Unit tests, integration tests

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### For MTG
- Could assist players with decisions
- Teaches strategy through explanation
- Enables AI playtesting of decks

### For You
- Practice software engineering
